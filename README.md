# Efficient-Frontier-Watches

The Efficient Frontier is a concept from Modern Portfolio Theory introduced by Harry Markowitz in his 1952 paper, "Portfolio Selection". The Efficient Frontier represents a set of portfolios that are considered optimally diversified, providing the highest possible expected return for a given level of risk. In other words, any portfolio that lies on the Efficient Frontier is expected to achieve the best possible return for its level of risk, assuming that returns are normally distributed. (ChatGPT)

In the context of the **`WatchCollection`** class, each **`Watch`** instance represents a different investment asset, in this case, a different watch. The **`calculate_efficient_frontier`** method computes the Efficient Frontier for a collection of watches. It does this by calculating the expected returns and the covariance matrix for the set of watches, then using optimization techniques to find the set of portfolio weights that minimize the portfolio's volatility for a range of target returns. Each portfolio's volatility and expected return are then plotted on a graph, with volatility on the x-axis and expected return on the y-axis. This graph is known as the Efficient Frontier.

The **`get_min_vol_weights`** method returns the portfolio weights for the portfolio with the lowest volatility among those on the Efficient Frontier. This portfolio is also known as the "Minimum-Variance Portfolio". This portfolio is expected to provide the best possible return for the lowest level of risk.

It's important to note that this analysis makes several assumptions, including that the returns of the watches are normally distributed and that the relationships between the watches remain constant over time. These assumptions may not hold true in reality, and as such, any investment decisions should not be made solely based on this analysis. It is always recommended to use such models as part of a broader analysis that includes other factors and risk considerations.
